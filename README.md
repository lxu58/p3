Assignment 
Made By Laihong Xu

Short Memo: I just figure out adding type within the tile function, and start writing some rules about it
            such as different interactions of clicks on different tiles. And thought about add four direction
            fences, but run out of time, sorry. But I know how to code it. 

Description:
        I am trying to make a farm with animals in it. Whenever you click the tile, you will add either pig or sheep.

        if you click on the flower, it won't add the animal, pig will be added if the flower is on the right/top side of the selected tile
        sheep will be added if the flower is on the left/bottom side of the selected tile. Pig nose will be added if you click the water pit.

        I made logic for generate ground and grass, the grass won't stand alone if it's surrounded by ground and vice versa!



Artist statement:
            I am doing something more important this week, so didn't achieve what I want to do for this assignment.

            Something can be improve: I should make flower (fence) tile as separate layer, so the logic of generation will even look better!!!


            I was planning to add four-direction fences, bigger water pits (for example, 4 tiles next to each other will form a bigger water pit)
            but I couldn't do that because I am failed to load the image. But my algorithm is ready to go and finish the adding the type of each tile
            which will allow me to make if-loop (which i already did for clicking) to achieve the previous plan. 

            THE DIFFICULTY IS NEEEEEED HELP LOADING IMAGE, I spent 4 hours doing research about this, but still didn't get it. 
            The error is either "Image is not defined" "width is not defined"   >.<ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³
            Will come office hour if no one knows on discord...
